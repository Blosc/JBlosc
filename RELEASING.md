## Preliminaries

* Make sure that `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `ANNOUNCE.md` are up to date with the latest news in the release.

* Check that tag `<version>` in pom.xml is updated. 

* Commit the changes:

```console
    $ git commit -a -m"Getting ready for X.Y.Z release"
```

## Testing

```console
  $ mvn clean install
```

## Releasing

Go to the [project releases](https://github.com/Blosc/JBlosc/releases) and click on the `Draft a new release` button.  In the `Release title` box put "JBlosc VERSION", and in the `Describe this release` box put the initial contents of the ANNOUNCE.md.

## Announcing

* Send an announcement to the blosc and comp.compression lists.  Use the ``ANNOUNCE.md`` file as skeleton (possibly as the definitive version).

## Post-release actions

* Edit tag `<version>` in pom.xml to increment the version to the next minor one (i.e. X.Y.Z --> X.Y.(Z+1).dev).

* Create new headers for adding new features in ``RELEASE_NOTES.md`` and add this place-holder instead:

  #XXX version-specific blurb XXX#

* Commit the changes:

```console
    $ git commit -a -m"Post X.Y.Z release actions done"
    $ git push
```

That's all folks!
